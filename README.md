# Naufal Personal Portfolio

This is my personal portfolio website. I made this website to showcase my skills and projects that I have done. I also made this website to practice my skills in web development. This is a solution to the [Space tourism website challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/space-tourism-multipage-website-gRWj1URZ3).
